Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental value delivery while maintaining backward compatibility. The core mathematical approach remains sound throughout all enhancements, ensuring that the fundamental reliability and predictability are preserved.

The enhancement roadmap transforms patience from a sophisticated retry tool into a **comprehensive solution for API rate limit management and coordination** - addressing a critical need in modern distributed systems and cloud-native architectures.
