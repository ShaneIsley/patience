# Potential Features for patience CLI

This document outlines potential enhancements and features that could be added to the patience CLI tool, organized by priority level.

## Completed Features ✅

### Backoff Strategies (Implemented)
The following backoff strategies have been fully implemented and tested:

- ✅ **HTTP-Aware Strategy:** Intelligent HTTP response parsing that respects Retry-After headers and JSON retry fields for optimal server-directed timing.
- ✅ **Exponential Strategy:** Industry-standard exponential backoff with configurable base delay, multiplier, and maximum delay caps.
- ✅ **Linear Strategy:** Simple, linear backoff option (1s, 2s, 3s, etc.) for predictable, incremental delays.
- ✅ **Fixed Strategy:** Constant delay between retries for simple, predictable timing.
- ✅ **Jitter Strategy:** Full jitter backoff implemented to prevent thundering herd issues when multiple instances retry simultaneously.
- ✅ **Decorrelated Jitter Strategy:** Advanced AWS-recommended jitter strategy that combines exponential backoff with smart randomization for distributed systems.
- ✅ **Fibonacci Strategy:** Fibonacci sequence-based backoff (1s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s, etc.) as a less aggressive alternative to exponential backoff.
- ✅ **Polynomial Strategy:** Configurable polynomial growth with customizable exponent for fine-tuned delay patterns (sublinear, linear, quadratic, etc.).
- ✅ **Adaptive Strategy:** Machine learning-inspired strategy that learns from success/failure patterns to optimize retry timing over time.

### Configuration System (Implemented)
The following configuration features have been fully implemented:

- ✅ **Configuration Files:** TOML-based configuration with auto-discovery (.patience.toml, patience.toml).
- ✅ **Environment Variables:** Full support for PATIENCE_* environment variables.
- ✅ **Configuration Precedence:** CLI flags > environment variables > config file > defaults.
- ✅ **Debug Configuration:** --debug-config flag to show configuration resolution sources.
- ✅ **Validation:** Comprehensive configuration validation with clear error messages.

## High Priority Features

*No high priority features currently identified.*

## Medium Priority Features

### Enhanced Pattern Matching

#### JSON Response Patterns
Add built-in support for common JSON response patterns:
```bash
# API success/failure detection
--success-pattern '"status":"success"'
--success-pattern '"error":null'
--failure-pattern '"error":\s*"[^"]+"'
--failure-pattern '"status":"(error|failed)"'
```

#### HTTP Status Code Patterns
Built-in patterns for HTTP response codes:
```bash
# Common HTTP responses
--success-pattern "HTTP/[0-9.]+ (200|201|202|204)"
--failure-pattern "HTTP/[0-9.]+ (4[0-9]{2}|5[0-9]{2})"
--success-pattern "Status: (200|201|202)"
```

#### Deployment/Infrastructure Patterns
Patterns for modern infrastructure tools:
```bash
# Kubernetes/Docker
--success-pattern "(deployment|pod|service).*(ready|running|available)"
--failure-pattern "(failed|error|crashloopbackoff|imagepullbackoff)"

# CI/CD pipelines
--success-pattern "(build|deploy|test).*(successful|passed|completed)"
--failure-pattern "(build|deploy|test).*(failed|error|timeout)"
```

#### Database/Connection Patterns
Common database and service connectivity patterns:
```bash
# Database connectivity
--success-pattern "connection.*(established|successful|ok)"
--failure-pattern "(connection.*(refused|timeout|failed)|unable to connect)"

# Health checks
--success-pattern "(healthy|up|available|responding)"
--failure-pattern "(unhealthy|down|unavailable|not responding)"
```

### Predefined Pattern Sets
Simplify common use cases with predefined pattern collections:
```bash
# Instead of complex regex, use shortcuts
patience --pattern-set api-json -- curl api.example.com
patience --pattern-set k8s-deploy -- kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
patience --pattern-set health-check -- ./health-check.sh
```

### Multi-Line Pattern Support
Support for patterns that span multiple lines:
```bash
# For complex output spanning multiple lines
--success-pattern-multiline "(?s)Starting.*Complete"
--failure-pattern-multiline "(?s)Error.*Stack trace"
```

### Numeric Threshold Patterns
Pattern matching based on numeric values in output:
```bash
# For monitoring/metrics
--success-threshold "response_time < 500"
--failure-threshold "error_rate > 0.05"
```

### Advanced Pattern Logic
More sophisticated success/failure logic combinations:
```bash
# More nuanced success/failure logic
--success-when "exit_code=0 AND pattern='success'"
--failure-when "exit_code!=0 OR pattern='error'"
```
