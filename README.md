# patience

A simple, reliable command-line tool for retrying commands until they succeed. Built with Go and designed to be your patient companion when dealing with flaky commands, network requests, or any process that might need a second (or third, or fourth) chance.

## Why patience?

We've all been there – a deployment script fails because of a temporary network hiccup, a test flakes out randomly, or an API call times out just when you need it most. Instead of manually running the same command over and over, let `patience` handle the tedious work for you with grace and wisdom.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive** – Just prefix your command with `patience`
- **Configurable attempts** – Set how many times to try
- **Smart backoff strategies** – Choose between fixed delays or exponential backoff
- **Timeout protection** – Prevent commands from hanging indefinitely
- **Pattern matching** – Define success/failure based on output patterns, not just exit codes
- **Preserves behavior** – Your command's output and exit codes work exactly as expected
- **Zero dependencies** – Single binary that works anywhere

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaneisley/patience.git
cd patience
go build -o patience ./cmd/patience
```

### Quick Test

```bash
# Test with a command that always succeeds
./patience -- echo "Hello, World!"

# Test with a command that fails (will retry 3 times by default)
./patience -- false
```

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax is simple: `patience [flags] -- command [args...]`

```bash
# Retry a flaky curl command up to 5 times
patience --attempts 5 -- curl https://api.example.com/status

# Add a 2-second fixed delay between attempts
patience --attempts 3 --delay 2s -- ping -c 1 google.com

# Use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
patience --attempts 5 --delay 1s --backoff exponential -- flaky-api-call

# Set a timeout for each attempt
patience --timeout 30s -- wget https://large-file.example.com/download

# Combine all options with exponential backoff and max delay
patience --attempts 5 --delay 500ms --backoff exponential --max-delay 10s --timeout 30s -- deployment-script

# Pattern matching - succeed when output contains "success" (even if exit code is non-zero)
patience --success-pattern "deployment successful" -- deploy.sh

# Pattern matching - fail when output contains "error" (even if exit code is zero)
patience --failure-pattern "(?i)error|failed" -- health-check.sh

# Case-insensitive pattern matching
patience --success-pattern "SUCCESS" --case-insensitive -- deployment-script

## Pattern Matching

Many real-world commands don't use exit codes properly. A deployment script might print "deployment successful" but exit with code 1, or a health check might exit with code 0 but print "Error: service unavailable". Pattern matching solves this by letting you define success and failure based on the command's output.

### Success Patterns

Use `--success-pattern` to define when a command should be considered successful, regardless of exit code:

```bash
# Deployment tools that don't use exit codes properly
patience --success-pattern "deployment successful" -- kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# API responses that indicate success
patience --success-pattern "\"status\":\"ok\"" -- curl -s https://api.example.com/status

# Multiple success indicators (regex OR)
patience --success-pattern "(success|completed|ready)" -- health-check.sh
```

### Failure Patterns

Use `--failure-pattern` to define when a command should be considered failed, even with exit code 0:

```bash
# Catch error messages in output
patience --failure-pattern "(?i)error|failed|timeout" -- flaky-script.sh

# Specific failure conditions
patience --failure-pattern "connection refused|network unreachable" -- network-test.sh

# JSON error responses
patience --failure-pattern "\"error\":" -- api-call.sh
```

### Pattern Precedence

Patterns are evaluated in this order:
1. **Failure pattern match** → Command fails (exit code 1)
2. **Success pattern match** → Command succeeds (exit code 0)  
3. **Exit code** → Standard behavior (0 = success, non-zero = failure)

### Case-Insensitive Matching

Add `--case-insensitive` to make pattern matching case-insensitive:

```bash
# Matches "SUCCESS", "success", "Success", etc.
patience --success-pattern "success" --case-insensitive -- deployment.sh
```

### Regex Support

Both success and failure patterns support full regex syntax:

```bash
# Match specific formats
patience --success-pattern "build #\d+ completed" -- build-script.sh

# Word boundaries
patience --failure-pattern "\berror\b" -- log-parser.sh

# Capture groups and alternatives
patience --success-pattern "(deployed|updated) successfully" -- deploy.sh
```

## Command-Line Options

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--attempts` | `-a` | `3` | Maximum number of attempts |
| `--delay` | `-d` | `0` | Base delay between attempts (e.g., `1s`, `500ms`) |
| `--backoff` | | `fixed` | Backoff strategy: `fixed` or `exponential` |
| `--multiplier` | | `2.0` | Multiplier for exponential backoff |
| `--max-delay` | | `0` | Maximum delay for exponential backoff (0 = no limit) |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | `0` | Timeout per attempt (e.g., `30s`, `5m`) |
| `--success-pattern` | | | Regex pattern indicating success in stdout/stderr |
| `--failure-pattern` | | | Regex pattern indicating failure in stdout/stderr |
| `--case-insensitive` | | `false` | Make pattern matching case-insensitive |
| `--help` | `-h` | | Show help information |

## How It Works

1. **Run your command** – `patience` executes your command exactly as you would
2. **Check the result** – Determine success using pattern matching (if configured) or exit code
3. **Pattern precedence** – Failure patterns override success patterns, which override exit codes
4. **Exit on success** – If the command succeeds, `patience` exits immediately (remaining attempts are skipped)
5. **Calculate delay** – Use fixed delay or exponential backoff based on attempt number
6. **Wait patiently** – If it fails, wait for the calculated delay and try again with grace
7. **Respect limits** – Stop after the maximum number of attempts or max delay reached
8. **Preserve exit codes** – The final exit code matches your command's result

## Exit Codes

- **0** – Command succeeded on any attempt (remaining attempts skipped)
- **1** – Command failed due to failure pattern match
- **Non-zero** – Command failed after all retry attempts (matches the command's final exit code)

**Note:** `patience` exits with the result of the first successful attempt, not the last attempt.

## Behavior

**Important:** `patience` stops immediately when a command succeeds - it does not execute remaining attempts.

- ✅ **Exits on first success** - If attempt 1 succeeds, attempts 2-N are never executed
- 🔄 **Only retries on failure** - Success means the job is complete
- 📊 **Preserves exit codes** - Your command's original behavior is maintained
- ⏱️ **Efficient execution** - No wasted time on unnecessary attempts

### Examples:
```bash
# If API is up on attempt 1, attempts 2-5 are skipped
patience --attempts 5 -- curl https://api.example.com/health

# Only retries while the service is starting up
patience --attempts 10 --delay 1s -- nc -z localhost 8080

# This stops immediately if the first curl succeeds
patience --attempts 5 -- curl https://api.example.com
# Output: "✅ Command succeeded after 1 attempt" (attempts 2-5 never run)
```
